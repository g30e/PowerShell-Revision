# CLI-Revision
## Nothing is original here
I'm simply collecting CLI commands I find useful.  
I intend to collect here PowerShell cmdlets, bash commands, KQL queries, Python scripts, and any other useful commands I've come across.  
I usually use StandardNotes for this but many people who are smarter than me have recommended GitHub. So, I'm giving it a go.
